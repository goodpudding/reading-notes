## *Gameover man, gameover!*

* *Explain why we need domain modeling.* We need domain modeling because can create objects to do very specific tasks.

* *Why should tables not be used for page layouts?* You don't want to use tables for page layouts because it makes the website hard to navigate for those with vision impairment. It also becomes a logistical nightmare and tables aren't auto responsive. 

* *List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.* Align, which is used to align the text in the table. Height, which sets the height of the table and width, which sets the total width of the table. 

* *What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?* Constructors allow us to our object literal from only being able to hold 1 set of data and instead be able to take in several objects process them.
  
* *How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?* When you use .this with a constructor, it will only be referencing the new data set, where as when you use it in an object literal, its in the object, so it is only referencing the same data set. 
  

* *Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.* Okay, I hope I got this right. So, at my first job tacobell, I was taught how to greet a customer when they entered the store. I would call that my greeting prototype, because it gave me a base of what my greeting should be like going for. When I started working at mcdonalds, I took some of the greeting from the old job, applied it to the new job and updated it with new information of the new job. So I had inheritted parts from my protoype, but I was still able to update it with the new information from my new job. If that's close to right, then I think I'm starting to get it, otherwise I'm lost. 

Write a sentence about the subject matter. Go into depth about what I learned and what it might mean to me in the future. Give an example from the reading.

# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Learn HTML

* **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?** When ever you are listening things and they dont know to be in a particular order
 
* **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?** Using css list-style-type: cirle, disc, square
 
* **When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?** Well, you want to use an order list if you are doing step by step instructions or ranking, where as unordered, you want to use that if there is no particular meaning in the order of the information. 

* **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?** By using the start or the type attribute

## Learn CSS

* **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?** Well, if our main character is the content, then the padding and margin would be support characters like a parent or friend. They help define the main characters world. 

* **List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.** Padding, margin, border and content

## Learn JS

* **What data types can you store inside of an Array?** I'm pretty sure you can use all data-types, but I know for sure strings, numbers, objects and arrays. 

* **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?** I don't think it is because it's trying to use an array within an array, which I believe is possible, but you first would have to substantiate the items of the first array to be used in the second. Then you would access it like **const people=['person[0]', 'person[1]', 'person[2]']** I actually think it would work now, but I think the way I posted would also work?

* **List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.** x += f() is basically taking the f() adding x and spitting out the sum. Same principle for x -= f(), except subracting the x. x * = f() multiplies f() by x. x / = f() divides x by f(). x * * = f() is x to the f() power. 

* **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.** I would say it spits out NaN or not a number, because its trying to do math equations with strings and booleans. That won't work.

* **Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.** I hope this applies. I have these large water purifiers that sit in my fridge and everytime I op the fridge, I run a conditional statement in my head that if the jug is less that half full, I fill it. 

* **Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.** When trying to validate data. For example, if you have a prompt and you are expecting a number, you might want a loop to check that you actually got a number. 

* **Write a sentence about the subject matter. Go into depth about what I learned and what it might mean to me in the future. Give an example from the reading.**
Basically the reading went over different type of functions in html, css and js. HTML going over when to us ordered lists and unordered lists. Css going over the box  model. JS going over arrays and conditional statements. 
## Something I want to learn more
Using arrays. I really want to dive into what can be done with them and use them to their full potential.

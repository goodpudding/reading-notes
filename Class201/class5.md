# Images, Color, Test

## **HTML Media**

* *What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?* Alt text is essential for accessibility to your website for those who are vision impaired.
* *How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?* Including alt text, but also making sure that they are they appropriate file type, so they don't need to be any larger than they need to be, for quicker loading.
* *Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.* It would be great if you wanted to include a figure caption
* *Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.* A gif is a low resolution image or sometimes a series of images to show a low resolution video. svg uses math to create lines that can be scaled infinitly and it will still be a crisp clean image. 
* *What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?* I would probably use a png, because its a little lighter than jpeg, but still has decent quality. 

## **Learn CSS**

* *Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.* Think of a webpage like a play. The background is in the background, so like a back drop. Foreground would be like a prop or stage item that would be in front of the actors and foreground. The content would be like the actors, in the middle. 
* *Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?* First, I would come up with a color scheme with my friend, then I would use that color scheme throughout the website, making sure to make elements pop and readable. 
* *What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?* Loadability and readability. You want to make sure that you aren't using some obscure font pack that no one will have, therefore no one will read your website. 
* *What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?* size says how large the font is. weight is like bold or thin, how thick the font is. Style is like how you would italics the text.
* *Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.* You could mess with the padding or margin.

Write a sentence about the subject matter. Go into depth about what I learned and what it might mean to me in the future. Give an example from the reading.
I am very familiar with svgs and different media forms, so that was pretty easy for me. The CSS isn't difficult, its just so much to take in. All the different ways that I can mess with all the different elements. I think it will just be a matter of practice and exposure.

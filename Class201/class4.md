# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

* *To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?* We create an anchor tag using <a></a> usually paired with href
* *The href attribute contains what information?* It stands for hypertext reference, so its reference other hypertext aka another link. 
* *What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?* By incorporating alt text with detailed descriptions of images and by using compressed images so our site will load fast. 

## CSS Layout
* *What is meant by “normal flow”?* I believe normal flow referes to how css normally displays things, so to take something out of normaly flow it to have it set aside or by locking it with fixed positioning. 
* *What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?* Block level adjusts to its parent elements size, where inline adjusts to its content. 
**Static** *positioning is the default for every html element.*
* *Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.* Absolute positioning is great for things like navigation bars, where you want it to we in a fixed spot, always on screen. 
* *What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?* Fixed position is refering to a fixed position on the webpage, where as absolute positing is for the display window, so it will always be in the same spot as the user scrolls. 

## Learn Javascript
* *Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.* Function delcaration is creating the rules for the function and function invocation tells the function to go ahead an run. You are able to pass data into the funtion so that it can change with input.
* *What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?* In the reading, it seems like that means the same thing. It is just the information in the paranthesis that you pair with the function. 


Write a sentence about the subject matter. Go into depth about what I learned and what it might mean to me in the future. Give an example from the reading.

Html, I feel like pretty easy. The CSS is really blowing my mind. There are so many ways to effect color, positioning, size, just everything that can be adjust and the way to adjust it is a lot to take in. I think memorizing the difference between the different positioning will take lots of time and practice. The demo that Sheyna gave us will help. I took a c++ course before, so I'm very comfortable with the intro concepts of functions and I actually look forward to mastering them.

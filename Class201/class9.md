## Introduction To Events.

* *How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?* An event is anything that is happening on a webpage. So when you hit post on instagram, thats an event. When you click play on a website, thats an event. 
* *When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?* The name of the listener and the data for the function
* *Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?* The even object is like that parameters for a function. It is something that automatically gets passed into the event. The target is useful because it is how we access that event object.
* *What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?* Where as event bubbling is handling events that are nest inside of elements and going top down, event capture goes from nested elements out or bottom up.

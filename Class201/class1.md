Write a sentence about the subject matter. Go into depth about what I learned and what it might mean to me in the future. Give an example from the reading.
A lot of this informations is just getting a closer look at the things I sort of know already. It's really reinforcing this idea that HTML is structure, like the 2x4 frame of a house, the CSS is the style, so the color and trim that makes it look nice and Javascript is I guess like appliances. Things that can be operated in the house.

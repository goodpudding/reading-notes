# AWS: Cloud Servers

## AWS EC2

- _What is an EC2 Instance?_

  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 instances can be used to run applications, host websites, and store data. Users can easily scale up or down their computing capacity as needed, and only pay for what they use.

- _Name 2 use cases for EC2._

  - Hosting a website and gaming platforms

- _Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com._

  - I would probably say the best reason is infrastructure. With AWS, you probably have the most robust adabable nextworking options.

## EC2 For Humans

- _Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?_

  - After you log on, it should be under the services dropdown menu

- _Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL._

  - The general difference is the computing power. The micro has less power than the XL

- _Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend._

  - A compute cycle is like a worker doing a task. The worker starts with an input, processes it, and produces an output. A computer does the same thing, taking in data, processing it, and producing a result. The more compute cycles a computer can perform in a given time, the faster and more powerful it is.

## Elastic Beanstalk

- _What is Elastic Beanstalk?_

  - Its an aws service that lets you auto deploy your server

- _Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk._

  - Elestic beanstalk makes the deployment of EC2 servers efforless.

- _Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk._

  - I would probably say scalability and the way it can stream line the process.

* *How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)*

  * 
useReducer and useContext are two React hooks that together can significantly streamline state management in complex React applications. useReducer is used for managing intricate state logic, accepting a reducer function and an initial state as arguments, and returning the current state and a dispatch function. This dispatch function can trigger actions that modify the state based on the logic defined in the reducer function, making it an excellent choice for complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

useContext is used to share 'global' data across a tree of React components, eliminating the need for prop drilling and making global state accessible at various levels. When useReducer and useContext are combined, the state and dispatch function from useReducer can be exposed to the component tree using useContext, allowing any component to read or modify the state. In summary, useReducer handles state management while useContext provides a mechanism to make that state available to any component that requires it, thereby simplifying state management in your React application.

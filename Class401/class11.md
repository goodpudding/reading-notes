# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

* *What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?*

  * EvenEmmitter
* *What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?*

  * Because OOP has many modules that talk to one another, we can use an event listener to reverse the flow of communication. 
* *Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.*

  * Event Driven Programming is a way of writing code that responds to events, or actions that happen in a system. This is often used in web development on the front-end, where events might include things like clicking a button or submitting a form.

In Node.js, Event Driven Programming can be useful on the backend because it allows the server to respond to events from multiple sources, such as user requests or incoming data. By writing code that responds to events, Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously without getting bogged down or crashing.

For example, if a server receives a large amount of incoming data, it can use event-driven programming to handle each piece of data as it arrives, rather than waiting for the entire request to finish before processing it. This can help improve the performance and efficiency of the server, making it faster and more reliable.

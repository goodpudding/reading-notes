# *Node Ecosystem*

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

* *How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?*

  * Node is a nifty program that allows programs that I write be able to run, since the code I write in activates when its called, node allows me to call that program that I wrote. 

* *What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?*

  * It means that it allows javascript to run. Whereas something like C# needs a compiler to create it as a standalone program, Javascript is used when its called on so it needs a runtime. A timeframe to activate. 

* *What is Node used for?*

  * Node is what allows javascript to execute. Its like how in js, a function won't run unless you invoke it. With Node, you're invoking your javascript file.

I guess I'm pretty excited to learn about AWS and React Native. I think being able to build apps will be really handy and from my understanding, you can with React Native.

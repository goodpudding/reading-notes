# Access Control (ACL)

## 5 steps to RBAC

- _What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?_

  - Its like on canvas how the students have student permissions, so we're only allowed to access information about us, where the teachers have different roles and different access, so they have more permissions.

- _Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC._

  - I think I just did

- _What approach might you take to implement RBAC?_

  - First you would need to Inventory your systems and determine what roles you need to create and who needs what. Add new ones if necessary. Periodically audit your RBAC to ensure permissions are up to date.

## wiki - RBAC

- _If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?_

  - Are you where you belong

- _Name three primary rules defined for RBAC._

  - Role Assignment, Role Authorization, Permission Authorization

- _Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend._

  - If you have ever used a student portal for a class, then think of the roles for a student vs a teacher vs an amdinistrator and how their roles on the schools system would have different permissions to what they could access.

## BAC tutorial

- _What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain._

  - They would be asscociated with the role because you would have multiple have the same level of access.

- _Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?_

  - Authenicates or proves their identity

- _Explain how RBAC might benefit a business._

  - Well, think if you have a website selling custom made goods. You would need a role for users, to look at products, place orders, access their order history. You would need a role for your employees to look at incoming orders, manage time sheets, request time off. You would need a role for the managers to schedule employees, manage inventory, etc. You probably would need a role for accounting, to keep track of money. Lots of benefits.

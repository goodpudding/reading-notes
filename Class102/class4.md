# Read: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

## This reading was basically going over the begining stages of web design

* Make your wire frame simple and clear, don't worry about the color or details, just function

* You should test it out and see if it works the way you want. Have someone else try it

* HTML is very easy, because the syntax tells you what info you should put in it

* The purpose of the wire frame and the html is structure your website so that when you apply the CSS later, it will work

My degree is in filmmaking and from my understanding, the wire frame is basically like the storyboard of the film. Its a rough idea of how it will look and function, but it only functions as a structure for the details to be planned around. HTML is actually pretty easy, because of semantics. It tells you what type of element is being used.

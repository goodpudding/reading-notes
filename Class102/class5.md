# Read: 05 - Design web pages with CSS

## *CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is a way of taking the information presented with HTML and change the properties(i.e. color, size, location, opacity, etc.)*

* CSS uses tags or ids as a selector. Then it takes a property and gives it a value.

* There is Internal, External and Inline ways to use CSS with HTML

  * Internal is when the CSS is used within the HTML(usually with the style inside the head element)

  * External is when the CSS is in a seperate document that is used in tandem with teh HTML

  * Inline is when the CSS is used within a line of HTML

It makes sense that there is the HTML doc and the CSS doc, but conveinent that you could also include css directly into HTML if its something small. Using your wireframe really helps you write the HTML in a way that functionally makes sense and should make apply the CSS to the HTML really easy. Another film analogy, its like editing the film when you have the storyboard. If planned things out, then its super easy to look at the preproduction for design choices.

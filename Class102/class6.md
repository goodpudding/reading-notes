# Read: 06 - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## *JavaScript(whcih is not the smae as java) is a langauge that enables functionalitly to the website, so that it can do more than just display information.*

* JavaScript is a JIT(Just-in-time compilation) aka dynamic translation, which is a combination of AOT(Ahead-of-time comilation) and interpretation. Basically, it to where the code could use inputs in real time to execute preprogrammed functions

* Similar to CSS, JS can be added directly in to the code of HTML, but it is better to have an external document that the HTML points to

I'm really excited to start implementing JavaScript. It makes your website more interactive and dynamic. I'm starting to see how much webdesign is actually an art form. As you work on your website, you add layer on layer and it starts to really come to life.

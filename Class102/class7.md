# Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript

## *The reading was diving deeper into JavaScript and what it can do. It went in depth about functions, expressions and operators*

* Control flow is the order in which the code executes. For the most part, the code is linear, except for conditional or loop functions.

* Defining a function, you first say the name of the function, list the parameters of the function in parentheses, then JavaScript functions that define the function.

* The different type of operators include: Assignment, Comparison, Arithemetic, Bitwise, Logical, BigInt, String, Conditional (ternary), Comma, Unary, Relational.

* You have to declare the function before you use it, so you have to be sure you put your function in a place that makes sense. You also need to keep in mind the scope of the function. If you put a function within a parent function, then you can't use that function outsite the scope of the parent function.

I took a class for JavaScript before, so most of this is just a resfresher, but I like what JS allows webdevelopers to do.
